# Tether-Health-Capstone
# Tether (Capstone) — Team Husky Bloom

Tether is a UW Informatics capstone project exploring a trustworthy, user-friendly way to help people make sense of fragmented health information. Our MVP focuses on a simple, patient-centered experience for uploading a small set of documents and written inputs, then generating clear, digestible summaries with strong guardrails (not medical advice).

## Team
- Daaniya — Product Management Lead 
- Neha — UX Design Lead 
- Romina — Data Science Lead
- Reachny — User Research Lead 
- Jocelyn — Backend & Frontend Lead 

## Project Goals 
- Provide a simple, trustworthy chat-based experience for basic, patient-centered questions
- Support limited uploads (e.g., ~5 PDFs + ~10 written inputs) for early testing
- Generate structured, easy-to-read summaries and insights
- Prioritize transparency, privacy-conscious data handling, and usability over feature depth

> **Disclaimer:** This project is a prototype for research and testing purposes and does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

## Repository Structure (planned)
This repo will include:
- `frontend/` — web client (UI)
- `backend/` — API server, AI integration, and data handling
- `docs/` — architecture diagrams, data flows, research notes, and handoff documentation
- `scripts/` — helper scripts for local setup (optional)

(These folders may change as the team finalizes scope and implementation details.)

## Tech Stack (tentative)
- Frontend: Next.js / React
- Backend: Node.js
- Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (TBD)
- AI: LLM API integration (provider TBD)


## Running Locally (placeholder)
Once implemented, you can expect steps similar to:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run backend and frontend

We will provide exact commands in this README once the initial scaffolding is complete.


## Contributing
This project is developed by Team Husky Bloom as part of the UW Informatics Capstone. 


## Documentation & Handoff
We will maintain ongoing documentation in `docs/` to support the required Capstone Handoff/Closeout deliverables, including:
- Architecture + data flow diagrams
- API specs
- Data retention notes
- AI guardrails + prompt design notes
- Setup + deployment guides
